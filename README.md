## Link to the project 


In this photo i have recreating the MacOS dock animation you see when hovering an app icon on desktop. We do this by combining both the new CSS has() selector and CSS variables in a smart way. This results in us being able to quite closely replicate the dock animation, without the use of any animation libraries like Framer Motion or GASP.

## Tools used

React, TypeScript, Vanilla CSS (using the `has()` selector! only) and CSS Variables.
